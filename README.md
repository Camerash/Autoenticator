### What is Autoenticator?
Autoenticator is an app that helps you accept 2FA request on your phone automatically.
It works even if the screen is off.

### How does it work?
It works by helping you to press the confirm button when the 2FA request notification pops up.
Therefore it will need the access of your notifications.

### Security and privacy
This app will only access notifications of the mobile app "Duo Security", and it will only perform the confirm action without accessing its data.
This project is completely open-sourced and its source code is available on this repo.
